# Cable transmission line modelling

The cable in electrical systems are imposing more challenges to the EMC design as the switching devices running at faster speed. It's even more so in power electronics systems.

Here it proposes an easy method to model the cable transimission line by extracting the lumped sum parameters from performing an easy open circuit (OC) and short circuit (SC) impedance scan using LCR meter.
